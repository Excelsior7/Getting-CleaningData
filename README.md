## GETTING AND CLEANING DATA PROJECT

### This repository includes:

***

1. A script **run_analysis.R** developed in the **R** language:    
    + INPUT : A dataset whose source can be found at the following link [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).
    + OUTPUT : Two **tidy** datasets :
        + features_datatable.csv.
        + features_datatable_2.csv.  

***

2. A code book **CodeBook.md**:  
    + Study Design : This section explains the design of the experiment conducted by the researchers that resulted in the dataset on which this analysis is based (see link above).  
    + Code book : The purpose of this section is to present the dataset passed as input to our **run_analysis.R** script by presenting its variables **features.txt** and their units. This section helps us understand what to expect when we try to understand the dataset. This section also presents the two data sets - **features_datatable.csv.**;**features_datatable_2.csv.** - in order to better understand how these two data sets (the *OUTPUT*) differ from the one used as input for the analysis.
